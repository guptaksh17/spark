# Gamification System Setup Guide

## 🎮 Current Status
The gamification system is now working with a simplified implementation that logs actions to the console. The UI and functionality are fully operational.

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Optional - For Full Functionality)

To enable full database persistence, run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

### 1. Create Tables
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of: supabase/gamification_setup.sql
```

### 2. Update Supabase Types
After creating the tables, regenerate your Supabase types:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### 3. Enable Full Functionality
Once the database is set up, replace the simplified functions in `src/lib/gamification.ts` with the full database implementation.
